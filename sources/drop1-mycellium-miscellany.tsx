      "By minting this commemorative GLB Newtro coin, you'll be directly helping the Newtro community to develop actions such as:\n\n* Covering our \"Arts and W3B\" workshop to onboard new artists on the blockchain (thus making it free for artists!)\n\n* Helping us develop cultural actions such as having our own IRL exhibition with works from Newtro's Latin American community (thus helping us being independent from galleries!)\n\n* Helping us develop cultural actions such as podcasts, newsletter, content on social media, conversatories and much more to help spread the word of tokenized art.\n\n* Helping us develop a powerful dApp and web, the central hub for our Latam community (already being developed!)\n\n* Access to future token gated content (already being developed too!)\n\nAnd much more!\n\nNone of our actions are charged upon artists, we are a community of artists searching for self sustenance and independence \n\nThank you very much for supporting arts, culture and our collective ❤",
