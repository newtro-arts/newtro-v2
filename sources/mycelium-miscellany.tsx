      "By minting this gorgeous commemorative GLB token, you'll be directly helping the Newtro community to develop actions such as: \n\n- Covering our \"Arts and W3B\" workshop to onboard new artists on the blockchain (thus making it free for artists!)\n\n- Helping us develop cultural actions such as having our own IRL exhibition with works from Newtro's Latin American community (thus helping us being independent from galleries!)\n\n- Helping us develop cultural actions such as podcasts, newsletter, content on social media, conversatories and much more to help spread the word of tokenized art.\n\n- Helping us develop a powerful dApp and web, the central hub for our Latam community.\n\n- Future possibility of burning this token to redeem a NFT from Newtro's community (this is a dynamic we want to explore, but still we cant confirm)\n\n- And much more!\n\nNone of our actions are charged upon artists, we are a community of artists searching for self sustenance and independence ‚ù§\n\nThank you very much for supporting our project!",

Through media discourse, which makes use of clickbait headlines about million-dollar sales of cryptoart, this phenomenon manages to capture the public's attention in order to introduce them to the cryptocurrency market. In this way, cryptoart is inserted into society as a new field of artistic production that is mainly characterized by its commoditization through the use of blockchain technology. This book proposes to inquire into the relationship between cryptoart and its emergence in the semiocapitalism context ‚Äìa concept introduced by philosopher Franco Berardi‚Äì. Emphasizing the way in which we relate to technology, it will first explain the functioning of these innovations. Secondly, it will proceed to analyze the context in which this phenomenon emerges. Third, it will analyze the technological discourse imparted by the media and the fanaticism for an ideal of the future. Then, by examining the relationship between artist-social media, presenting works of digital art and describing one's own experience, it will seek to arrive at a definition of cryptoart by describing its characteristics and contrasting it with categories proper to the autonomy of modern art such as style, avant-garde and originality. Finally, this book will be accompanied by a glossary and a manual to facilitate access to those artists who want to be part of this community.\n\nKeywords: cryptoart, NFT, social media, future, semiocapitalism, art market, digital art",
