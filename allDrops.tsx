    "description": "🔍 With this book I received my degree in Electronic Arts (UNTREF). It is an objective look at the new technologies inscribed in an economic-political context and how the artist stands before all these new possibilities of production. Written, originally in Spanish, between 2021 and 2022 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. \n\n📚 All the money generated by this NFT will be used to make physical prints of the book peer year and to expand our educational activities in @newtroarts \n\n🌟UPDATE: If everything goes well in 2024 the first mints will come🌟\n\n🍄 This piece was made in community and collaboration as a part of the NewtroArts’ \"Mycelium & Miscellany\" collective drop on the Zora network. \n\n●•●•●●•●•●●•●•●●•●•●●•●•●\n\nAbstract: In 2021, online news portals exploded with articles about cryptoart and non-fungible tokens, better known by their acronym NFT. Through media discourse, which makes use of clickbait headlines about million-dollar sales of cryptoart, this phenomenon manages to capture the public's attention in order to introduce them to the cryptocurrency market. In this way, cryptoart is inserted into society as a new field of artistic production that is mainly characterized by its commoditization through the use of blockchain technology. This book proposes to inquire into the relationship between cryptoart and its emergence in the semiocapitalism context –a concept introduced by philosopher Franco Berardi–. Emphasizing the way in which we relate to technology, it will first explain the functioning of these innovations. Secondly, it will proceed to analyze the context in which this phenomenon emerges. Third, it will analyze the technological discourse imparted by the media and the fanaticism for an ideal of the future. Then, by examining the relationship between artist-social media, presenting works of digital art and describing one's own experience, it will seek to arrive at a definition of cryptoart by describing its characteristics and contrasting it with categories proper to the autonomy of modern art such as style, avant-garde and originality. Finally, this book will be accompanied by a glossary and a manual to facilitate access to those artists who want to be part of this community.\n\nKeywords: cryptoart, NFT, social media, future, semiocapitalism, art market, digital art",
