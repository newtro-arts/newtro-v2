Manipulating hardware orchestrates an electron ballet, blurring the boundaries between macro and micro scales, akin to the interconnected nature of rhizomatic connections. This synthesis embodies an organic, non-hierarchical essence, inviting a myriad of interpretations and diverse perspectives.\n\nWithin the creative act lies a ceremonial embrace woven into symbols, where chaos assumes a pivotal role, welcoming spontaneity and unpredictability. As the unforeseen intertwines with the artist\'s intent, the artwork stands as a testament to dissolving boundaries between creator and creation. It beckons observers onto a journey, a living entity and spiritual automaton resonating with the vibrancy of multiplicity and the mysterious essence of becoming.\n\n---\n\nThis piece is the result of our monthly ‚ÄúArts and W3B‚Äù community workshop, as a part of the NewtroArts‚Äô "Mirrorscape" collective drop on the Zora network.

Through media discourse, which makes use of clickbait headlines about million-dollar sales of cryptoart, this phenomenon manages to capture the public's attention in order to introduce them to the cryptocurrency market. In this way, cryptoart is inserted into society as a new field of artistic production that is mainly characterized by its commoditization through the use of blockchain technology. This book proposes to inquire into the relationship between cryptoart and its emergence in the semiocapitalism context ‚Äìa concept introduced by philosopher Franco Berardi‚Äì. Emphasizing the way in which we relate to technology, it will first explain the functioning of these innovations. Secondly, it will proceed to analyze the context in which this phenomenon emerges. Third, it will analyze the technological discourse imparted by the media and the fanaticism for an ideal of the future. Then, by examining the relationship between artist-social media, presenting works of digital art and describing one's own experience, it will seek to arrive at a definition of cryptoart by describing its characteristics and contrasting it with categories proper to the autonomy of modern art such as style, avant-garde and originality. Finally, this book will be accompanied by a glossary and a manual to facilitate access to those artists who want to be part of this community.\n\nKeywords: cryptoart, NFT, social media, future, semiocapitalism, art market, digital art",
